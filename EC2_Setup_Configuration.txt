Connecting EC2 instance using Putty
------------------------------------
Download putty.exe and puttygen.exe file

The private key provide by amazon is not accessable directly through putty so we need to convert this in to required format fot that puttygen tool is required

Then open the puttygen tool and load the pem file and save it as private key.

Then in order to connect to putty we need 3 things which we get from amazon console in the instance click on connect
1->Host name i.e --> ec2-18-217-251-33.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
2->Username --> on Data section under the connection category in putty , copy the desired user name and past it there like -> ubuntu
3->Authentication key i.e. the .pem private key which we have converted through puttygen tool -->Go to SSH->Auth import the converted file

Then go back to the sessions section then save our current session provide a name to that session then click on open , Next time using the saved session we can able to open

Now we are able to access our EC2 instance :: great

pwd

hostname

nslookup ip-172-31-25-177

lets do some shell sample program

vi hello.sh

insert echo "Hello amazon"

then save and quite using wq

run the file ./sh
