Create a Spring boot application and build it once we have the jar file build then we need to upload into the S3 bucket

Create a bucket on S3 click on create and provide a name then create then upload the file to S3 bucket and provide Grant public read access then click on next

Then need to install java on ubuntu EC2 instance 

java -version --> it will prompt to use default java version

need to update package manager of ubuntu --> sudo apt update

Then update jre --> sudo apt-get install default-jre

java -version --> Now java is installed on our EC2 instance

Then download spring application jar in to EC2 instance 

go to S3 bucket copy the application link i.e. https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/springbootpranab/springboot-jpa-poc-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

use below command to download file from S3.

wget https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/springbootpranab/springboot-jpa-poc-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar . ->Download and put it on same folder

if not then download winscp and connect to EC2 instance copy the jar file

java -jar springboot-jpa-poc-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -->will start the server on port 8080

how to access the application 

go to EC2 instance and get the name of the server

ec2-18-217-251-33.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

port -->8080

http://ec2-18-217-251-33.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/getAllStudents
